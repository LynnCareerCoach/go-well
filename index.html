                        <p>THE STORY OF THE <strong>Four World Views</strong> MAP</p>
                        <p>The "flat earth conspiracy" was probably conceived by students in a mapmaking class, because representing the earth's features on a flat surface is about as easy as peeling an orange without tearing the rind.</p>
                        <p>Making a world map involves distorting the surface of the sphere that is Earth so it conforms to a two-dimensional rectangle. You may preserve accuracy in direction (useful for ships navigating the ocean), but then you must sacrifice size proportionality (say, the size of South America compared to Greenland). When you choose a Coordinate Reference System, you're choosing what your priority is and what you're willing to give up in order to preserve that priority.</p>
                        <p>It took me a while to wrap my head around the projection concept (pun intended), but I think I understand it. Well, mostly.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>THE PROBLEM TO SOLVE</p>
                        <p><strong>What is the difference between world maps using different CRS?</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Goode Homosoline:</strong> The sizes of each continent are accurate in proportion to the others, but distances are distorted especially near the poles</p>
                        <p><strong>Equidistant Cylindrical:</strong> Navigation is easier (north and south stay constant) but latitudes are equally spaced, giving more accurate representation of distance along the north-south axis</p>
                        <p><strong>Mercator:</strong> Better for navigation (north and south stay constant like equidistant cylindrical), but greater distortion at the poles makes continents farther from the Equator seem bigger than they actually are</p>
                        <p><strong>Robinson:</strong> Less distortion in the middle of the map as compared to Mercator, and the poles have more severely curved lines for longitude, so the distances between continents can be grasped more accurately</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>TOOLS USED / SKILLS LEARNED</p>
                        <p>Concepts of how information is taken from a sphere and represented (with varied limitations) in a two-dimensional map</p>
                        <p>Learned how ArcGIS (incorrectly) assumes the projection settings for the first map layer should apply to added layers, and how to fix this “on the fly” reprojection problem</p>
                        <p>Also gained better understanding of how map layers interact with each other, and the difference between defining projection, or setting the coordinate system when it was undefined (Define projection) vs converting one CRS to another (ProJECT tool)</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>When the four CRS views are compared side by side, they look distinctly different:</p>

                        <p>THE STORY OF THE <strong>Hispanic population</strong> MAPS</p>
                        <p>Can a map answer a simple question, like how many Hispanic people are in the US, in more than one way? I've been interested in social psychology's "nudge theory" for a long time - basically, the environment we find ourselves in has a huge impact on our decisions.</p>
                            <p>The same concept applies to making maps. The exercises that led to the creation of these maps made me think about how a small tweak--of a graduated color ramp, symbology, or data classification break--can significantly change the perception for a map's viewer. When looking at the US Hispanic population size on a state-by-state basis, Illinois being in the top five while New Mexico was only 9th surprised me. When I dug deeper, I realized that with more than 12 million people in Illinois compared to New Mexico's 2 million, the number of Hispanic people would be greater in Illinois, while the rate of Hispanic people as a percentage of population would be much greater in New Mexico.</p>
                            <p>After looking at data classification strategies, I have a more sophisticated understanding of how population size can look different than density, which can also look different than rate (percent of total population). Depending on the story you want to tell, a map can look very different, and this makes map design a powerful communication tool.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>These next two maps show the difference between population density and population rate (percentage of total population):</p>

                        <p>THE STORY OF THE <strong>Philly Schools Near Bike Network</strong> MAP</p>
                        <p>This map is the one that took me the longest to create, and the one that nearly caused me to give up on this class. I won't try to describe all the ways I wanted to destroy my laptop while trying to get the symbols right or the legend... legible.</p>
                            <p>Let's just say that before learning to select by attribute and figuring out how to identify a subset of items within an initial selection, I had to read the Lab 1 tutorial about a thousand times. (My favorite sentence was "You can also select features from a set of features which are already selected, or alternatively, select a set of features from a set of selected input features." She sells seashells by the seashore?</p>
                            <p>Now I understand it's about slicing data up in one way, then taking those results and dicing them another way. The slicing and dicing is tricky because if you zig before you zag, your results can be ZERO... or a zillion.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>This map shows the five largest Philadelphia schools that are close to the bike network, which would help kids bike to school more safely.</p>

                    <p>Much of what I gained from this class is not limited to GIS or even to geography, but centers on how visual communication methods can tell stories in a powerful way. Each time the same data was displayed in a different way -- proportional symbol as opposed to dot density, census-tract-level as opposed to state-level choropleth, even choice of graduated colors -- the map can imply emphasis, create an argument or even risk producing bias.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">The other important skill I developed in this class is tenacity. For me the biggest difficulty was getting back onto my laptop the next day after I had stayed up late struggling to figure out a feature of ArcGIS. It was incredibly difficult to keep trying again and again, but it did feel great when I finally broke through to he other side.</p>
