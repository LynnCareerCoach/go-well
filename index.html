                            <p>THE STORY OF THE <strong>Four World Views</strong> MAP</p>
                            <p>The "flat earth conspiracy" was probably conceived by students in a mapmaking class, because representing the earth's features on a flat surface is about as easy as peeling an orange without tearing the rind.</p>
                            <p>Making a world map involves distorting the surface of the sphere that is Earth so it conforms to a two-dimensional rectangle. You may preserve accuracy in direction (useful for ships navigating the ocean), but then you must sacrifice size proportionality (say, the size of South America compared to Greenland). When you choose a Coordinate Reference System, you're choosing what your priority is and what you're willing to give up in order to preserve that priority.</p>
                            <p>It took me a while to wrap my head around the projection concept (pun intended), but I think I understand it. Well, mostly.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>THE PROBLEM TO SOLVE</p>
                            <p><strong>What is the difference between world maps using different CRS?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Goode Homosoline:</strong> The sizes of each continent are accurate in proportion to the others, but distances are distorted especially near the poles</p>
                            <p><strong>Equidistant Cylindrical:</strong> Navigation is easier (north and south stay constant) but latitudes are equally spaced, giving more accurate representation of distance along the north-south axis</p>
                            <p><strong>Mercator:</strong> Better for navigation (north and south stay constant like equidistant cylindrical), but greater distortion at the poles makes continents farther from the Equator seem bigger than they actually are</p>
                            <p><strong>Robinson:</strong> Less distortion in the middle of the map as compared to Mercator, and the poles have more severely curved lines for longitude, so the distances between continents can be grasped more accurately</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>TOOLS USED / SKILLS LEARNED</p>
                            <p>Concepts of how information is taken from a sphere and represented (with varied limitations) in a two-dimensional map</p>
                            <p>Learned how ArcGIS (incorrectly) assumes the projection settings for the first map layer should apply to added layers, and how to fix this “on the fly” reprojection problem</p>
                            <p>Also gained better understanding of how map layers interact with each other, and the difference between defining projection, or setting the coordinate system when it was undefined (Define projection) vs converting one CRS to another (ProJECT tool)</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>When the four CRS views are compared side by side, they look distinctly different:</p>

                    <p>Much of what I gained from this class is not limited to GIS or even to geography, but centers on how visual communication methods can tell stories in a powerful way. Each time the same data was displayed in a different way -- proportional symbol as opposed to dot density, census-tract-level as opposed to state-level choropleth, even choice of graduated colors -- the map can conveys emphasis or even demonstrate bias.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">The other important skill I developed in this class is tenacity. For me the biggest difficulty was getting back onto my laptop the next day after I had stayed up late struggling to figure out a feature of ArcGIS. It was incredibly difficult to keep trying again and again, but it did feel great when I finally broke through to he other side.</p>
